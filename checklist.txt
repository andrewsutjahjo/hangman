Flask API

Game itself:
    start_session(self, username):
        v if session exists:
            - continue, save or reset?
        v initialize session
            return

    start_game:
        check session:
        - read list of words (from word reader for extensibility)
        - save as set of letters in session
        - guessed letters
        - return length of _

    guess_letter:
        - check session:
        - check for ascii
        - if letter !in set(guessed_letters)
            if letter in set(word_to_guess)
                return __ with filled in letters
            else
                decrement attempts_remaining
                if attempts_remaining  == 0:
                    Game over dude
                    continue, save or reset?
                return
        - return '''You've already guessed this letter. I'd use your guess for another letter'''

    save_highscore:
        - get session
        - save highscore (to file)
        - reset session

Client:
    gets dict from API
    print number of attempts remaining
    print guessed letters in set
    print _ with letters filled in.

unittest:
    should start a session

    should start a game with a user_id

    should return a reponse
    should return '''Non ascii response'''
    should return  '''guess another letter''' if letter in set of words
    should update the session correctly
        - when a letter is guessed correctly
            - and update the word
            - and update the guessed_letters
            - and update the word state
            - and not update the attempts remaining
        - when a letter is guessed incorrectly
            - and not update the word
            - and update the guessed_letters
            - and update the word state
            - and update the attempts remaining

    should reset a session when a high score is saved

State:
    - use Flask session
    dict: {
    word_to_guess
    word_state:
    guessed_letters
    attempts_remaining
    user_id
    score
    }

pluspoints?
    - dockerize API and client
    - if len(guess) == len(word_in_session) check if completely correct
    - add username question at start: and save
